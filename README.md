Python implementation of the Win-Test UDP protocol.

Win-Test (http://win-test.com) is a tool used for Ham Radio Contesting.

This is currently a partial implementation of the protocol, mainly
by reverse engineering the protocol by sniffing the UDP traffic.

The author of this code is not affiliated in any way with the Win-Test
developers.

# Protocol documentation

There is some partial protocol documentation from the Win-Test developers
